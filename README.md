# Primary Owen Tracker
This is a site made to track CSH's Primary Owen. Check [pot.csh.rit.edu](https://pot.csh.rit.edu/) to find the current primary Owen.

# Rules
In order to become the Primary Owen you must:
* Challenge all existing Owens to some form of contest and defeat them all
  * Any other current Owen must only defeat the Primary Owen
  * Any number of Owens can be challenged at any time
* Any Owen is capable of refusing a challenge
* All Owens must be notified of an ongoing or pending challenge
* If the Primary Owen refuses challenges for a time period that Skyler Clark deems unreasonable they can be removed as Primary Owen
* The loser of the final challenge becomes the sub-Owen
* Skyler Clark is the ultimate authority on who/what is the Primary Owen

# Current Owens
* Owen Sullivan
* Owen Miller
* Rowan D'Ausilio
